# predicting-mvp-in-nba-seasons

In this project, we're predicting MVP (top 5) in NBA seasons of 2000 to 2023 with machine learning. By the end of this project, we'll have a model that can predict MVPs across the years with the best performance. The repository consists of three steps on three different files:

* `1-web_scraping.ipynb`    : Web scraping to get the data from the [website](www.basketball-reference.com),
* `2-data_cleaning.ipynb`   : Data cleaning for training of machine learning, and
* `3-mvp_predictions.ipynb` : MVP predictions utilizing several machine learning models.
